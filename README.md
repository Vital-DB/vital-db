# Vital DB
*The one stop shop for all things vital to your health.*

## Background

We are interested in giving people and health professions an easier access to health records.  Just an overall easier hub to have all of your medical information.  The health field has so many records so organization is extremely important.

## Overview

We will be using AWS, Google Maps API, and other technologies to let users have a easy access to all of their health information.  Will be able to upload images of their records and/or manually up to our site.  A dashboard with easy to read information readily available for users at all times.  Alerts for next checkup reminder, prescription info, prescription reminders, etc to make sure that the user knows when their health needs need to be met.

## Technical Challenges
- Security
  - Securing our users' forms and medical information is our most critical priority.
- AWS
  - Allowing our users to upload PDFs and scans of their medical records requires us to use a cloud hosting technology like AWS.
- Google Maps API
  - A stretch feature of ours is to allow users to look for nearby doctors and medical providers right on the app.
