## Technical Challenges
- Security
  - Securing our users' forms and medical information is our most critical priority.

  - Allowing our users to upload PDFs and scans of their medical records requires us to use a cloud hosting technology like AWS.
- Google Maps API
  - A stretch feature of ours is to allow users to look for nearby doctors and medical providers right on the app.
